    <p>Shot through the heart<br>
      And you're to blame<br>
      Darling, you give love a bad name<br><br>
      
      An angel's smile is what you sell<br>
      You promise me heaven, then put me through hell<br>
      Chains of love got a hold on me<br>
      When passion's a prison, you can't break free<br><br>
      
      Oh, oh, you're a loaded gun<br>
      Oh, oh, there's nowhere to run<br>
      No one can save me<br>
      The damage is done<br><br>
      
      Shot through the heart<br>
      And you're to blame<br>
      You give love a bad name (bad name)<br>
      I play my part<br>
      And you play your game<br>
      You give love a bad name (bad name)<br>
      You give love<br>
      A bad name<br><br>
      
      Paint your smile on your lips<br>
      Blood red nails on your fingertips<br>
      A school boy's dream, you act so shy<br>
      Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye<br><br>
      
      Oh, oh, you're a loaded gun<br>
      Oh, oh, there's nowhere to run<br>
      No one can save me<br>
      The damage is done<br><br>
      
      Shot through the heart<br>
      And you're to blame<br>
      You give love a bad name (bad name)<br>
      I play my part<br>
      And you play your game<br>
      You give love a bad name (bad name)<br>
      You give love<br><br>
      
      Shot through the heart<br>
      And you're to blame<br>
      You give love a bad name<br>
      I play my part<br>
      And you play your game<br>
      You give love a bad name (bad name)<br><br>
